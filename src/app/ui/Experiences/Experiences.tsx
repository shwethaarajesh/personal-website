            As a Samsung PRISM Research Intern,  I led the optimization of a deep learning model, demonstrating GRU's superiority over LSTM with a 91% accuracy in MOS score estimation. Managed a dataset of 10,000+ noise recordings, implemented a custom mixing algorithm, and pioneered MFCC adoption, reducing Mean Squared Error from 0.21 to 0.167. Culminated with a mobile app for real-time MOS score estimation, earning a certificate of excellence for substantial contributions."

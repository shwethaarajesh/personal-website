            As a Software Development Engineer I, I contributed to the development of multiple applications, 
            focusing on core components like search functionality, filters, and UI elements. 
            I led a team of six in building a Figma plugin to streamline designer workflows and spearheaded the creation of an innovative tool 
            that converted wireframes into responsive, production-ready codeâ€”reducing development time by 80%. 
            I also played a pivotal role in migrating a mobile app from Xamarin Forms to .NET MAUI and React Native, 
            enhancing cross-platform compatibility and performance."

             delivering mini-applications weekly. I optimized search load times by 1.5x and overall performance by 3x for an e-commerce platform,
              earning a perfect accessibility score of 100%.
               I also implemented design changes under tight deadlines and mentored new hires, facilitating smoother adoption of Builder.io and 
               contributing to overall project success."

            As a Research Intern, I developed a deep learning model to estimate the Mean Opinion Score (MOS) for VoIP calls, 
            achieving 91% accuracy. I optimized the model using Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) and reduced Mean Squared Error (MSE) by 20%. 
            My contributions included creating a custom dataset of noise recordings and pioneering the use of Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients 
            (MFCCs) for audio preprocessing, ultimately improving real-time MOS score estimation."
